OpenPERouter is an open implementation of a Provider Edge (PE) router, designed to terminate multiple VPN protocols on Kubernetes nodes and expose a BGP interface to the host network.

**This project is in the early stage of development. Use carefully!**

## Enable L3 EVPN in your cluster

OpenPERouter enables L3 EVPN tunneling to any BGP enabled Kubernetes component,
such as Calico, MetalLB, KubeVip, Cilium, FRR-K8s and many others, behaving as an external router.

Behaving as an external router, the integration is seamless and BGP based, exactly as if a physical
Provider Edge Router was moved inside the node.

## Enable L2 EVPN in the cluster

OpenPERouter supports L2 overlays, allowing seamless communication between nodes using a stretched
layer 2 domain.

## Overview

Where we normally have a node interacting with the ToR (Top of Rack) switch, which is configured to map the VLans to a given VPN tunnel,
OpenPERouter runs directly in the node, exposing one Veth interface per VPN tunnel.

After OpenPERouter is configured and deployed on a cluster, it can interact with any BGP-speaking component of the cluster, including FRR-K8s, MetalLB, Calico and others. The abstraction is as if a physical Provider Edge Router was moved inside the node.

Here is a high level overview of the abstraction, on the left side a classic Kubernetes deployment connected via vlan interfaces, on the right side a deployment of OpenPERouter on a Kubernetes node:
