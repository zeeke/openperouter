This example demonstrates how to integrate OpenPERouter with MetalLB to
advertise LoadBalancer services across the SRv6 L3VPN fabric, enabling
external access to Kubernetes services.

## Overview

MetalLB provides load balancing for Kubernetes services by advertising
service IPs via BGP. When integrated with OpenPERouter, these BGP routes
are automatically redistributed into the SRv6 L3VPN, making the services
reachable across the entire fabric.

### Example Setup

The full example can be found in the
[project repository](https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter/examples/l3vpn/metallb)
and can be deployed by running

```bash
make docker-build demo-metallb-l3vpn
```

This example exposes two different services over two different overlays by
configuring two L3VPNs on the OpenPERouter and peering MetalLB on the
sessions corresponding to each VPN.

## Route Advertisement Flow

Once configured, the integration works as follows:

1. **Service Creation**: Kubernetes LoadBalancer service is created with an
   IP from the pool
2. **MetalLB Processing**: MetalLB assigns an IP and starts advertising it
   via BGP
3. **BGP Session**: MetalLB advertises the route to OpenPERouter through
   the veth interface
4. **SRv6 L3VPN Redistribution**: OpenPERouter redistributes the BGP route
   into the SRv6 L3VPN
5. **Fabric Distribution**: VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes with SRv6 SID are
   distributed to all fabric routers
6. **External Reachability**: External hosts can now reach the service
   through the fabric

## Traffic Flow

When external traffic reaches the service:

1. **External Request**: External host sends traffic to the service IP
2. **Fabric Routing**: Fabric routes the traffic to the appropriate PE
3. **SRv6 Encapsulation**: Traffic is encapsulated using SRv6
4. **OpenPERouter Processing**: OpenPERouter receives and decapsulates the
   traffic
5. **Service Delivery**: Traffic is forwarded to the Kubernetes service
   endpoint
6. **Service Reply**: The service reply finds the route learned by FRR-K8s
   and is routed to the host that sent the request

## Configuration

### L3VPN Configuration

Configure one L3VPN for each overlay:

```yaml
apiVersion: openpe.openperouter.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3VPN
metadata:
  name: red
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  hostsession:
    asn: 64514
    hostasn: 64515
    localcidr:
      ipv4: 192.169.10.0/24
  vrf: red
  rdAssignedNumber: 100
  exportRTs:
  - "64514:100"
  importRTs:
  - "64520:100"
---
apiVersion: openpe.openperouter.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3VPN
metadata:
  name: blue
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  hostsession:
    asn: 64514
    hostasn: 64515
    localcidr:
      ipv4: 192.169.11.0/24
  vrf: blue
  rdAssignedNumber: 200
  exportRTs:
  - "64514:200"
  importRTs:
  - "64520:200"
```

### MetalLB BGP Peer Configuration

On the MetalLB side, configure the corresponding `BGPPeer` resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: peerred
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  myASN: 64515
  peerASN: 64514
  peerAddress: 192.169.10.1
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: peerblue
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  myASN: 64515
  peerASN: 64514
  peerAddress: 192.169.11.1
```

> **Note**: The `peerAddress` field specifies the router-side IP address.
> MetalLB establishes BGP sessions with OpenPERouter through the veth
> interfaces created for each L3VPN. Since the router-side IP is consistent
> across all nodes, you only need one BGPPeer configuration per L3VPN.

### BGP Advertisement Configuration

MetalLB is configured with two address pools associated with two different
namespaces (omitted here for brevity) and configured to advertise each pool
to the corresponding `BGPPeer`:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BGPAdvertisement
metadata:
  name: bgp-advertisement-red
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - address-pool-red
  peers:
    - peerred
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BGPAdvertisement
metadata:
  name: bgp-advertisement-blue
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - address-pool-blue
  peers:
    - peerblue
```

## Return Traffic Configuration

Once the pod behind the service replies, the traffic must find its way
back to the host that sent the request.

To enable this, the host must learn the routes advertised by the two
leaves (leafA and leafB) via BGP. We leverage the integration with
[frr-k8s](https://github.com/metallb/frr-k8s/) to add a configuration
that allows incoming routes to be added to the host:

```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: receive-all 
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64515
      neighbors:
      - address: 192.169.10.1
        asn: 64514
        toReceive:
          allowed:
            mode: all
      - address: 192.169.11.1
        asn: 64514
        toReceive:
          allowed:
            mode: all
```

## Verification

### Check BGP Session Status

Verify that the BGP sessions between MetalLB/FRR-K8s and the OpenPERouter
are established:

```bash
kubectl get bgpsessionstates.frrk8s.metallb.io -A
```

Expected output:
```
NAMESPACE        NAME                          NODE                    PEER           VRF   BGP           BFD
frr-k8s-system   pe-kind-control-plane-94ct2   pe-kind-control-plane   192.169.11.1         Established   N/1
frr-k8s-system   pe-kind-control-plane-bc9zh   pe-kind-control-plane   192.169.10.1         Established   N/A
frr-k8s-system   pe-kind-worker-496lk          pe-kind-worker          192.169.11.1         Established   N/A
frr-k8s-system   pe-kind-worker-s74kn          pe-kind-worker          192.169.10.1         Established   N/A
```

### Test Service Connectivity

#### Test from Red Overlay

First, check the service details:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n red
```

Expected output:
```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service-red   LoadBalancer   10.96.161.254   172.30.0.10   80:32732/TCP   2m3s
```

Test connectivity from a host connected to the red overlay:

```bash
docker exec clab-kind-hostSRV6_red curl 172.30.0.10
```

Expected output:
```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed
and working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Test from Blue Overlay

Try to access the same service from a host connected to the blue overlay:

```bash
docker exec clab-kind-hostSRV6_blue curl --max-time 2 \
  --no-progress-meter 172.30.0.10
```

Expected output:
```
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 2001 milliseconds
```

> **Expected Behavior**: The connection times out because the service is
> advertised only to the red network, demonstrating the network isolation
> between overlays.
