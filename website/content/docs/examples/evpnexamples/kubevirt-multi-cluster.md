This example demonstrates how to connect KubeVirt virtual machines running in
different Kubernetes clusters to an L2 EVPN/VXLAN overlay using OpenPERouter,
extending the [KubeVirt single cluster example](kubevirt.md).

## Overview
The setup creates both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VNIs, with OpenPERouter
automatically creating a Linux bridge on the host. Two KubeVirt virtual
machines are connected to this bridge via Multus secondary interfaces of type
`bridge`.

### Architecture

- **L3VNI (VNI 100)**: Provides routing capabilities and connects to external networks
- **L2VNI (VNI 110)**: Creates a Layer 2 domain for VM-to-VM communication
- **Linux Bridge**: Automatically created by OpenPERouter for VM connectivity
- **VM Connectivity**: VMs connect to the bridge using Multus network attachments

## Example Setup

> **Note:** Some operating systems have their `inotify.max_user_instances`
> set too low to support larger kind clusters. This leads to:
>
> * virt-handler failing with CrashLoopBackOff, logging `panic: Failed to create an inotify watcher`
> * nodemarker failing with CrashLoopBackOff, logging `too many open files`
>
> If that happens in your setup, you may want to increase the limit with:
>
> ```bash
> sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024
> ```

The full example can be found in the
[project repository](https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter/tree/main/examples/evpn/multi-cluster)
and can be deployed by running:

```bash
make docker-build demo-multi-cluster
```

The example configures both an L2 VNI and an L3 VNI. The L2 VNI belongs to the
L3 VNI's routing domain. VMs are connected into a single L2 overlay.
Additionally, the VMs are able to reach the broader L3 domain, and are
reachable from the broader L3 domain.

## Configuration

### 1. OpenPERouter Resources

Create the L3VNI and L2VNI resources (in **each** cluster):

```yaml
apiVersion: openpe.openperouter.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3VNI
metadata:
  name: red
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  vni: 100
  vrf: red
---
apiVersion: openpe.openperouter.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: L2VNI
metadata:
  name: layer2
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  hostmaster:
    type: linux-bridge
    linuxBridge:
      autoCreate: true
  l2gatewayips: ["192.170.1.1/24"]
  vni: 110
  vrf: red
```

**Key Configuration Points:**

- The L2VNI references the L3VNI via the `vrf: red` field, enabling routed traffic
- `hostmaster.autocreate: true` creates a `br-hs-110` bridge on the host
- `l2gatewayip` defines the gateway IP for the VM subnet

### 2. Network Attachment Definition

Create a Multus network attachment definition for the bridge:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: evpn
spec:
  config: |
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "evpn",
      "type": "bridge",
      "bridge": "br-hs-110",
      "macspoofchk": false,
      "disableContainerInterface": true
    }
```

### 3. Virtual Machine Configuration

Create two virtual machines with network connectivity (one VM in each cluster):

This VM should be created in cluster **A**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-1
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: vm-1
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
          - bridge: {}
            name: evpn
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: containerdisk
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: cloudinitdisk
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 2048M
        machine:
          type: ""
      networks:
      - name: evpn
        multus:
          networkName: evpn
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      volumes:
      - containerDisk:
          image: quay.io/kubevirt/fedora-with-test-tooling-container-disk:v1.5.2
        name: containerdisk
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          networkData: |
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              eth0:
                addresses:
                - 192.170.1.3/24
                gateway4: 192.170.1.1
        name: cloudinitdisk
```

This VM should be created in cluster **B**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-2
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: vm-2
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
          - bridge: {}
            name: evpn
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: containerdisk
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: cloudinitdisk
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 2048M
        machine:
          type: ""
      networks:
      - name: evpn
        multus:
          networkName: evpn
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      volumes:
      - containerDisk:
          image: quay.io/kubevirt/fedora-with-test-tooling-container-disk:v1.5.2
        name: containerdisk
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          networkData: |
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              eth0:
                addresses:
                - 192.170.1.30/24
                gateway4: 192.170.1.1
        name: cloudinitdisk
```

**VM Configuration Details:**

- Uses the `evpn` network attachment for bridge connectivity
- Cloud-init configures the VM's IP address and default gateway

## Validation

### VM-to-VM Connectivity

Test connectivity between the two VMs:

```bash
# Connect to VM console
virtctl console vm-1

# It may take about 2 minutes to start up and get to the login.
# Once it does, login with username "fedora" an password "fedora".

# Test ping to the other VM
ping 192.170.1.30
```

Expected output:
```
PING 192.170.1.30 (192.170.1.30): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.170.1.30: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.470 ms
64 bytes from 192.170.1.30: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.321 ms
```

### Packet Flow Verification

Monitor packet flow on the router to verify traffic:

```bash
# Check packets flowing through the bridge
tcpdump -i br-hs-110 -n
```

Expected packet flow:

```bash
13:56:16.151606 pe-110 P   IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.170.1.30: ICMP echo request
13:56:16.151610 vni110 Out IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.170.1.30: ICMP echo request
13:56:16.152073 vni110 P   IP 192.170.1.30 > 192.170.1.3: ICMP echo reply
13:56:16.152075 pe-110 Out IP 192.170.1.30 > 192.170.1.3: ICMP echo reply
```

### VM-to-External L3 Connectivity

With `192.168.20.2` being the IP of the host on the red network:

```bash
# Run this from the VM console (vm-1)
curl 192.168.20.2:8090/clientip
```

Expected output (vm-1):

```
192.170.1.3:37144
```

The pod is able to reach a host on the layer 3 network and the IP is preserved.

When monitoring traffic:

```bash
18:01:50.406263 pe-110 P   IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.168.20.2: ICMP echo request, id 21760, seq 0, length 64
18:01:50.406267 br-pe-110 In  IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.168.20.2: ICMP echo request, id 21760, seq 0, length 64
18:01:50.406284 br-pe-100 Out IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.168.20.2: ICMP echo request, id 21760, seq 0, length 64
18:01:50.406287 vni100 Out IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.168.20.2: ICMP echo request, id 21760, seq 0, length 64
18:01:50.406295 toswitch Out IP 100.65.0.0.39370 > 100.64.0.1.4789: VXLAN, flags [I] (0x08), vni 100
IP 192.170.1.3 > 192.168.20.2: ICMP echo request, id 21760, seq 0, length 64
```

**Traffic Flow Analysis:**
We see that the packet comes from the veth interface towards the bridge associated with VNI 110 (the default gateway), then is routed to the bridge corresponding to the layer 3 domain and finally encapsulated.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bridge not created**: Verify the L2VNI has `hostmaster.autocreate: true`
2. **VM cannot reach gateway**: Check that the VM's IP is in the same subnet as `l2gatewayip`
3. **No VM-to-VM connectivity**: Ensure both VMs are connected to the same bridge (`br-hs-110`)

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check bridge creation
ip link show br-hs-110

# Verify network attachment
kubectl get network-attachment-definitions

# Check VM network interfaces
virtctl console vm-1
ip addr show
```

## L2 VNI as KubeVirt dedicated migration network for cross cluster live migration

This example is another use-case we can realize using this multi-cluster
testbed. All its dependencies are pre-provisioned when you start this demo,
i.e. when run the following command:

```bash
make docker-build demo-multi-cluster
```

This will provision the testbed described in [architecture](#architecture), and
has one VM pre-provisioned in **each** cluster: `vm-1` in cluster A, and `vm-2`
in cluster B.

It also has a dedicated migration network set up in both clusters, which
happens to be implemented using an L2 VNI ! You can find links to the network
manifests below:
- [NAD](https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter/tree/main/examples/evpn/multi-cluster/cluster-a-migration-nad.yaml)
- [L2VNI](https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter/tree/main/examples/evpn/multi-cluster/cluster-a-migration-l2vni.yaml)

### Preparing the VM to be migrated

To achieve cross cluster live migration, you need to provision the VM in both
clusters - but, it is only running on one of them. In the "destination" cluster
it will have be stuck in `WaitingForSync` phase, until the source and
destination clusters coordinate to migrate the VM across.

Hence, you need to provision the following manifest in your **destination**
cluster:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-1
spec:
  runStrategy: WaitAsReceiver   # this is MANDATORY
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: vm-1
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
          - bridge: {}
            name: evpn
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: containerdisk
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: cloudinitdisk
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 2048M
        machine:
          type: ""
      networks:
      - multus:
          networkName: evpn
        name: evpn
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      volumes:
      - containerDisk:
          image: quay.io/kubevirt/fedora-with-test-tooling-container-disk:v1.6.2
        name: containerdisk
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          networkData: |
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              eth0:
                addresses:
                - 192.170.1.3/24
                gateway4: 192.170.1.1
        name: cloudinitdisk
```

**NOTE:** notice the running strategy on the VM is `WaitAsReceiver`.

The next preparation step is to create the **destination** cluster migration
CR. Provision the following manifest for that:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
metadata:
  name: vmim-target
  namespace: default
spec:
  receive:
    migrationID: abcdef
  vmiName: vm-1
```

The `migrationID` attribute is important - in the sense that the **source**
migration object must use the **same** migration ID. But it can pretty much be
anything.

Once the object is provisioned in the destination cluster, we need to
understand how to connect the migration controllers on both clusters. For that,
we need to inspect the status of the migration CR on the destination cluster.
Execute the following command:

```shell
kubectl get vmim vmim-target -ojsonpath="{.status.synchronizationAddresses}" | jq
[
  "192.170.10.128:9185"
]
```

### Issuing the cross cluster live migration command

Now we know which IP and port to use in our source cluster migration CR;
provision the following command in the **source** cluster (pay special
attention to the `connectURL` attribute):

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
metadata:
  name: vmim-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  sendTo:
    connectURL: "192.170.10.128:9185"
    migrationID: abcdef
  vmiName: vm-1
```

Once this CR is provisioned in the source cluster, the VM will be migrated from
the source to the destination cluster. It's state will be preserved, and
established TCP connections will still be alive in the destination cluster.
