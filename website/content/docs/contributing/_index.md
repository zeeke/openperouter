We would love to hear from you! Here are some places you can find us.

## Issue Tracker

Use the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter/issues) to file bugs and
features request. 

# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! Here's some information to get
you started.

## Code of Conduct

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct]({{%
relref "code-of-conduct.md" %}}). By participating in this project you
agree to abide by its terms.

## Code changes

Before you make significant code changes, please consider opening a pull
request with a proposed design in the `design/` directory. That should
reduce the amount of time required for code review. If you don't have a full
design proposal ready, feel free to open an issue to discuss what you would
like to do.

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this
purpose. Consult [GitHub
Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter/blob/main/DCO)
file for details.

## Code organization

The OpenPERouter codebase is organized to separate core functionality, supporting libraries, deployment resources, and documentation. Here is an overview of the most relevant directories:

- `cmd/` – Contains the main entry points for the OpenPERouter binaries. Please check the [architecture documentation]({{< relref "../architecture.md" >}}) for an overview of the binaries and their responsibilities.
- `api/` – Defines the Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and API types used by OpenPERouter.
- `internal/` – Contains internal packages that implement the core logic of OpenPERouter. This directory is not intended for use outside the project and is structured as follows:
  - `controller/` – Implements the controllers logic, including reconciliation loops and resource management for OpenPERouter components.
  - `conversion/` – Handles conversion logic between different API versions or resource representations.
  - `frr/` – Contains code related to FRRouting (FRR) integration, such as configuration generation and management.
  - `frrconfig/` – Manages FRR configuration files and templates used by OpenPERouter.
  - `hostnetwork/` – Provides utilities and logic for managing host networking aspects required by FRR to make EVPN work.
  - `ipam/` – Implements IP Address Management (IPAM) logic, including allocation and tracking of IP addresses.
- `operator/` – Contains the Kubernetes operator for OpenPERouter, including its main code, API, and configuration.
- `charts/` – Helm charts for deploying OpenPERouter and its components.
- `e2etests/` – End-to-end test suite for validating OpenPERouter functionality.

This structure helps keep the project modular, maintainable, and easy to navigate for contributors and users alike.

In addition to code, there's deployment configuration and
documentation:

- **Helm charts**: The `charts/` directory contains Helm charts for deploying OpenPERouter and its components. These charts provide a convenient way to install, upgrade, and manage OpenPERouter in Kubernetes environments. Refer to the README in the `charts/` directory for usage instructions and configuration options.

- **Configuration**: Deployment and runtime configuration files are located in the `operator/config/` directory. This includes manifests for Kubernetes resources, sample CRs, and other configuration templates. Review these files to understand how to customize OpenPERouter for your environment.

- **Website and Documentation**: The `website/` directory contains the source for the OpenPERouter documentation site. Contributions to documentation, guides, and tutorials are welcome. To propose changes, edit the relevant Markdown files and submit a pull request.

## Building and running the code

Start by fetching the OpenPERouter repository, with `git clone
https://github.com/openperouter/openperouter`.

From there, you can build the docker image locally by calling 

```bash
make docker-build
```

A comprehensive test environment can be deployed locally by using 

```bash
make deploy
```

Check [the dev environment documentation]({{< relref "devenv.md" >}}) for more details.

After deploying the ContainerLab environment together with Kind, the kubeconfig will
be available at `bin/kubeconfig`.

### Running the tests locally

You can run unit tests locally with:

```bash
make test
```

To run the end-to-end (e2e) tests, first ensure that the local development environment is running (see above), then execute:

```bash
make e2etest
```

This will run the e2e test suite against your local environment.

## Changes in the config

The master is `config`. Changes in crds are reflected in the operator via `make bundle`, in the
all in one manifests via `make generate-all-in-one`, in the helm chart via `make generate`.
Finally, running `make bundle` updates the operator manifests.

## Updating Dependencies

### Kubernetes Dependencies

To update all k8s.io and sigs.k8s.io dependencies to a specific version:

```bash
make bump-k8s-deps K8S_VERSION=v0.35.0
```

Or omit the version to automatically fetch and use the latest:

```bash
make bump-k8s-deps
```

### Go Version

To update the Go version across all files (go.mod, Dockerfile, etc):

```bash
make bump-go-version GO_VERSION=1.25.7
```

Or omit the version to automatically fetch and use the latest:

```bash
make bump-go-version
```

## Commit Messages

The following are our commit message guidelines:

- Line wrap the body at 72 characters
- For a more complete discussion of good git commit message practices, see
  <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>.

## Extending the end to end test suite

When adding a new feature, or modifying a current one, consider adding a new test
to the test suite located in `/e2etest`.
Each feature should come with enough unit test / end to end coverage to make
us confident of the change.
