This section explains the core concepts behind OpenPERouter and how it
integrates with your network infrastructure.

## Overview

OpenPERouter transforms Kubernetes nodes into Provider Edge (PE) routers
by running [FRR](https://frrouting.org/) in a persistent named network
namespace. This enables VPN functionality directly on your Kubernetes
nodes, eliminating the need for external PE routers.

OpenPERouter supports two overlay technologies:

- **EVPN/VXLAN**: Uses BGP EVPN as the control plane and VXLAN as the
  data plane for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlays.
- **SRv6 L3VPN**: Uses BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 as the control plane and SRv6 as
  the data plane for Layer 3 overlays, with IS-IS as the IGP underlay.
  See the [SRv6 L3VPN concepts]({{< ref "srv6" >}}) page for details.

## Network Architecture

### Traditional vs. OpenPERouter Architecture

In traditional deployments, Kubernetes nodes connect to Top-of-Rack (ToR)
switches via VLANs, and external PE routers handle VPN tunneling.
OpenPERouter moves this PE functionality directly into the Kubernetes
nodes.

### Key Components

OpenPERouter consists of three main components:

1. **Router Pod**: Runs [FRR](https://frrouting.org/) in a persistent
   named network namespace
2. **Controller Pod**: Manages network configuration and orchestrates the
   router setup
3. **Node Labeler**: Assigns persistent node indices for resource
   allocation

## Underlay Connectivity

### Fabric Integration

OpenPERouter integrates with your network fabric by establishing BGP
sessions with external routers (typically ToR switches).

#### Network Interface Management

OpenPERouter works by moving the physical network interface connected to
the ToR switch into the router's network namespace:

This allows the router to establish direct BGP sessions with the fabric
and receive routing information.

## Overlay Networks (VPNs)

### Virtual Networks

OpenPERouter supports the creation of multiple VPNs, each corresponding
to a separate VPN tunnel. This enables multi-tenancy and network
segmentation.

OpenPERouter supports the creation of multiple VPNs, allowing the
extension of a routed domain via a VPN overlay:

![](/images/openpehostvpnl3.svg)

It supports the creation of L2 VPNs (where possible), where the veth is
directly connected to a layer 2 domain

And it also supports a mixed scenario, where an L2 domain also belongs to
a broader L3 domain mapped to an L3 overlay

### L3 VPN Components

For each Layer 3 VNI (EVPN), OpenPERouter automatically creates:

- **Veth Pair**: Named after the VNI (e.g., `host-e-200@pe-e-200`) for
  host connectivity
- **BGP Session**: Configured over the veth pair connecting the router to
  the host, to allow BGP connectivity with the host
- **Linux VRF**: Isolates the routing space for each VNI within the
  router's network namespace
- **Route Translation**: Converts between BGP routes and EVPN routes

For each Layer 3 VPN (SRv6), OpenPERouter automatically creates:

- **Veth Pair**: Named after the VPN (e.g., `host-s-200@pe-s-200`) for
  host connectivity
- **BGP Session**: Configured over the veth pair connecting the router to
  the host, to allow BGP connectivity with the host
- **Linux VRF**: Isolates the routing space for each VPN within the
  router's network namespace
- **SRv6 SID Allocation**: Allocates SRv6 SIDs from the locator for VRF
  encapsulation/decapsulation
- **Route Translation**: Converts between BGP routes and VPNv4/VPNv6
  routes with SRv6 encapsulation

#### IP Allocation Strategy

The IP addresses for the veth pair are allocated from the configured
`localcidr` for each VNI:

- **Router side**: Always gets the first IP in the CIDR
  (e.g., `192.169.11.0`)
- **Host side**: Each node gets a different IP from the CIDR, starting
  from the second value (e.g., `192.169.11.15`)

This consistent allocation strategy of the router IP simplifies
configuration across all nodes, as any BGP-speaking component on the host
can use the same IP address for the router side of the veth pair.

## Control Plane Operations

The following sections describe the control plane operations based on an
EVPN example. For SRv6-specific control plane operations, see the
[SRv6 L3VPN concepts]({{< ref "srv6" >}}) page.

### Route Advertisement (Host → Fabric)

When a BGP-speaking component (like MetalLB) advertises a prefix to
OpenPERouter:

![](/images/openpeadvertise.svg)

1. The host advertises the route with the veth interface IP as the next
   hop
2. OpenPERouter learns the route via the BGP session
3. OpenPERouter translates the route to an L3VPN route
4. The VPN route is advertised to the fabric with the local router as the
   next hop

### Route Reception (Fabric → Host)

When EVPN Type 5 routes are received from the fabric:

![](/images/openpereceive.svg)

1. OpenPERouter installs the routes in the VRF corresponding to the VPN
2. OpenPERouter translates the VPN routes to BGP routes
3. The BGP routes are advertised to the host via the veth interface
4. The host's BGP-speaking component learns and installs the routes

## L2 VPN

For each Layer 2 VPN, OpenPERouter automatically creates:

- **Veth Pair**: Named after the VNI (e.g., `host-e-200@pe-e-200`) for
  Layer 2 host connectivity
- **Linux VRF**: Optional, isolates the routing space for each VPN within
  the router's network namespace

### Host Interface Management

Given the Layer 2 nature of these connections, OpenPERouter supports
multiple interface management options:

- **Attaching to an existing bridge**: If a bridge already exists and is
  used by other components, OpenPERouter can attach the veth interface
  to it
- **Creating a new bridge**: OpenPERouter can create a bridge and attach
  the veth interface directly to it.
- **Direct veth usage**: With the understanding that the veth interface
  may disappear if the pod gets restarted, the veth can be used directly
  to extend an existing Layer 2 domain

#### Automatic Bridge Creation

The automatic bridge creation is useful for those scenarios where an
existing layer 2 domain is extended automatically through the veth
interface: when the router pod is deleted or restarted, the veth interface
is removed (and then recreated upon reconciliation), while the bridge
remains intact, making it a good candidate for attaching to an existing
layer 2 domain (i.e. setting it as master of a macvlan multus interface).
