## Overview

[Grout](https://github.com/DPDK/grout) is an optional, DPDK-accelerated data plane that can replace the Linux kernel's networking stack for packet forwarding in OpenPERouter. When enabled, grout handles VXLAN encapsulation/decapsulation and routing in user-space using poll-mode drivers, while [FRR](https://frrouting.org/) continues to manage the control plane (BGP, EVPN, route exchange).

The integration is opt-in: grout is disabled by default and enabling it does not affect existing kernel-based deployments.

## Architecture

When grout is enabled, it runs as a sidecar container in the router DaemonSet pod. It exposes a UNIX socket that serves two consumers:

- **FRR (zebra)**: uses the [`dplane_grout`](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/basic.html#loadable-module-support) module to push forwarding entries into grout instead of the kernel's routing tables.
- **The controller**: uses the `grcli` CLI to configure grout ports, addresses, VRFs, and routes.

Compared to the default kernel-based deployment, enabling grout adds:

- A **grout sidecar container** in the router pod
- The `-M dplane_grout` module flag to FRR's zebra process
- The `GROUT_SOCK_PATH` environment variable for FRR to locate the grout socket
- `--datapath=grout` flag to the controller
- A shared `grout-socket` volume between the grout sidecar and the FRR container

## Current Scope and Limitations

Grout support is being delivered incrementally. The current implementation covers:

- **Underlay** interface setup via grout ports, including optional DPDK
  acceleration (`acceleratedConfig` on `NetworkDevice`)
- **L3Passthrough** forwarding via grout
- **L3VNI** (EVPN Layer 3 overlays) via grout TAP devices

The following are **not yet supported** with grout:

- L2VNI (EVPN Layer 2 overlays)
- Hardware acceleration of workload-facing VF pairs

By default grout uses **TAP devices** (`net_tap` with `remote=`) rather than
binding physical NICs to a DPDK poll-mode driver. Add `acceleratedConfig` to a
`NetworkDevice` to bind that device as a DPDK port instead. CI and Kind still
run grout in **`--test-mode`**, meaning no hugepages are required unless you
enable DPDK-bound ports on real hardware.

## Prerequisites

For TAP-based grout underlays, no special hardware is required — grout uses TAP
devices and test-mode. DPDK-accelerated underlay ports need a DPDK-capable NIC
(and `vfio-pci` loaded for non-bifurcated devices). Hugepage configuration is
required outside of grout `--test-mode`.

## Helm Configuration

Grout is configured under `openperouter.grout` in the Helm values:

```yaml
openperouter:
  grout:
    enabled: true
    image:
      repository: quay.io/openperouter/router
      tag: "main-grout"
      pullPolicy: ""
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "512Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `dataoath` | string | `kernel` | Datapath to use for L3 forwarding. "kernel" uses the standard Linux kernel datapath; "grout" adds a DPDK-accelerated sidecar that runs alongside FRR |
| `grout.image.repository` | string | `quay.io/openperouter/router` | Grout container image repository |
| `grout.image.tag` | string | `main-grout` | Grout container image tag |
| `grout.image.pullPolicy` | string | `""` | Image pull policy (defaults to Kubernetes default) |
| `grout.resources` | object | see above | Resource requests and limits for the grout container |

## Enabling Grout for L3Passthrough

The Underlay and L3Passthrough Custom Resources are the same as the kernel-based deployment. The only difference is enabling grout in the Helm values.

### Step 1: Install with Grout Enabled

```bash
helm install openperouter openperouter/openperouter \
  --set openperouter.grout.enabled=true
```

Or using a values file:

```yaml
# values.yaml
openperouter:
  grout:
    enabled: true
```

```bash
helm install openperouter openperouter/openperouter -f values.yaml
```

### Step 2: Configure Underlay and L3Passthrough

Apply the same CRs as the kernel-based passthrough setup. See the [Passthrough Configuration]({{< ref "passthrough.md" >}}) documentation for full details.

```yaml
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: Underlay
metadata:
  name: underlay
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  asn: 64514
  interfaces:
    - type: NetworkDevice
      networkDevice:
        interfaceName: toswitch
  neighbors:
    - asn: 64512
      address: 192.168.11.2
---
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: L3Passthrough
metadata:
  name: passthrough
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  hostSession:
    asn: 64514
    hostASN: 64515
    localCIDR:
      ipv4: 192.169.10.0/24
```

When grout is enabled, the controller configures FRR as usual but delegates the host network setup to the grout data path instead of kernel interfaces.

## DPDK-Accelerated Underlay Ports

`NetworkDevice` entries without `acceleratedConfig` keep the TAP+`remote=` path.
When `acceleratedConfig` is set, the controller binds the device as a DPDK port:

1. Resolves the PCI address from `/sys/class/net/<interfaceName>/device`
2. Saves the kernel driver and IP addresses to `/var/run/openperouter/grout/<interfaceName>.json`
3. Binds non-bifurcated NICs (for example Intel) to `vfio-pci`, or moves
   bifurcated devices (for example Mellanox mlx5) into the router namespace
4. Creates the grout port with `grcli interface add port u_<name> devargs <pci>`
5. Applies the scraped addresses to the grout port and adds a connected route
   on `main` so FRR can establish BGP sessions

The kernel netdev must already exist and typically already has its IP
configuration. The controller scrapes those addresses; they are not duplicated
in the Underlay spec. On teardown the original driver and addresses are restored.

`acceleratedConfig` is rejected when `--datapath=kernel`.

```yaml
apiVersion: network.openperouter.io/v1alpha1
kind: Underlay
metadata:
  name: underlay-dpdk
  namespace: openperouter-system
spec:
  asn: 64514
  interfaces:
    - type: NetworkDevice
      networkDevice:
        interfaceName: enp3s0f0v0
        acceleratedConfig:
          rxQueues: 4
          qSize: 1024
  neighbors:
    - asn: 64512
      address: 192.168.1.1
```

All `acceleratedConfig` fields are optional. `acceleratedConfig: {}` enables
DPDK attachment with grout defaults. `promiscuous` defaults to false. `mac`
overrides the NIC hardware address when set. `portName` overrides the grout
port name (`u_<interfaceName>` when unset).

## Verification

### Check Grout Sidecar Status

Verify that the grout container is running in the router pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n openperouter-system -l app=router
```

Check grout container logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n openperouter-system -l app=router -c grout
```

### Check BGP Sessions

Verify that BGP sessions are established. The control plane behavior is identical to the kernel-based deployment — FRR handles all BGP operations, with grout handling the forwarding plane.
